          I'm a rising junior at MIT, currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer
          Science and Electrical Engineering. I enjoy and place a strong focus
          on robotics and machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning
          and it's applications to Sim2Real training for whole body control of
          humanoids. I currently work with the Improbable AI Lab, where I
          develop reinforcement learning pipelines for humanoid robots,
          experiment with policy ensembles, and scale data collection for
          visuomotor policies. Iâ€™ve also contributed to projects across the
          robotics stackâ€”from teleoperation systems to control tuningâ€”during
          internships at [Stealth Robotics Startup] and Tangible Robotics. <br />
          <br />
          My work blends low-level programming, algorithmic rigor, and hands-on
          hardware debugging. I'm particularly interested in the Sim2Real
          problem and enabling intelligent robotic behaviors through
          data-efficient learning. With experience ranging from RISC-V
          architecture to CNN-based speech analysis, Iâ€™m driven by solving hard
          technical problems and building systems that actually work in the real
          world. Outside of academics, I play varsity soccer at MIT and enjoy
          diving deep into interdisciplinary research that pushes the boundaries
          of autonomous systems.
